Automated Login is a Java-based Selenium project that automates the everyday task of logging into a website. 
It simulates real user actions like opening the browser, filling in login details, and submitting the form to check whether the login is successful.
This automation helps avoid repetitive manual work and is useful in testing, quality assurance, and continuous integration processes.
